This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

This is a simple clone of the game Wordle now owned by the NYTimes. This is intended just as a simple
code sample to showcase my skills as a software developer and to give a sense of my coding style.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Run Tests

```bash
npm run test
```
